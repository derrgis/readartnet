# readartnet
a simple video player to artnet encoder output made with ofxArtnet 
This code was started by pierrextardif for my future artworks (see www.derrickgiscloux.com)
Debug and improvement by derrgis & hpwit.
Based on ofxArtnet if read a video (put one in the video subfolder) and convert it to artnet data.
The artnet matrix automatically resizes depending of the video XY dimension.
Be aware not to load a too big file. 32 x 180 was tested with success.
